  I am so happy to hear that!<br />

  That's wonderful! I'm really glad to hear that. It's actually really simple to become a vegan. When you are about to consume something (eating or making a purchase such as shoes), consider what went into making that product. If it involved harming animals, don't support it. If it didn't, you're good to go!<br />

  Here are some things that can help you get started!<br />
